# Re-engineering-of-Neural-Nets
Comparing different methods of using categorical variable inputs in Neural Nets.

Built neural nets from the scratch to implement output encoding using a vector of categorical variable combinations. 
This method is clearly explained in the attached paper (can also be found at www.elsevier.com/locate/neunet.)
This method is compared against 1-hot encoding and other simple ways of using categorical inputs.
